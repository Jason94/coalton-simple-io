;;; This example generates a file of random integers, then reads it
;;; back and sums them all.
;;;
;;; It creates one thread to read lines from the file, N-WORKERS
;;; number of threads to parse the lines into integers, and one
;;; thread to sum all of the integers togother. Two MChannels pass
;;; the data through the worker threads, and the main thread uses a
;;; Future to await the final sum produced by the summer-thread.
