;;; NOTE:
;;; (1) MVar's are preferred over Locks to signal between threads.
;;; Here, using locks avoids a circular "dependency" between the tests.
;;; (2) This is *not* an efficient way to use locks. MVar's or Condition
;;; Variables would be much better. However, for testing purposes iterating
;;; until the forked thread has completed keeps the tests simple.
;;; (3) In production code, it would be better to write an IO layer over
;;; a non-pure datastructure like Lock, instead of using `wrap-io` throughout.
;;; Using `wrap-io` like this makes it easier to accidentally leak side
;;; effects in an unpredictable way.
