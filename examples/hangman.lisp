;;; This example plays an interactive terminal game of Hangman.
;;;
;;; It demonstrates how to combine IO with monad transformers to
;;; employ other effects. The EnvT monad is used to thread static
;;; configuration throughout the program. The StateT monad is used
;;; to maintain the game-state, such as which letters have been
;;; guessed and how many incorrect guesses have been made.
;;;
;;; It also demonstrates several functions which are written in the
;;; "capabilities classes" style, which allows them to be used more
;;; flexibly, such as with the advanced looping constructs.
;;; NOTE: This can be verbose if a lot of capabilities are relied on.
;;; An alternative is to simply omit the 'declare' altogether, and
;;; the type inference will figure it all out correctly, if the
;;; function is (1) used consistently, and (2) only used in one package.
